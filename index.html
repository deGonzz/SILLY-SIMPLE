			Let's have a button called "Silly" that people press. And the button tells them "Do It". 
			And we want to put te result into a div that's below the button. Since we want to react 
			on the button and update the result, we should give both of them identifiers. So we call
			the result div "results".
		-->
		<button id="silly"> Do It </button> 
		<button id="clear"> Clear </button> <!-- clears the content of the result -->
		<div id="results"></div>

		<!-- 
			We want something to happen (that will go in the result div) when clicking on "Do It", so
			we create a script in which we'll hook up the elements of the page in terms if click events
			for the "Do It" button and how we want to update that result. We'll use a library called zepto
			that we'll download and put the source code into an external folder as "js/zepto.min.js". 
			Zepto because it is very much like the familiar Jquery and a lot smaller than it. And since 
			this application we're making is going to be ran on mobile, we're not going to need Jquery's
			ability to run on lots of different browsers because we know that the target browsers for us
			will be the Android browser.
		-->
		<script src="js/zepto.min.js"></script>
		<script src="js/silly.js"></script>

		<!-- 
			In the script we hook up with the #silly button ( "#" because it's an identifier) and we handle
			the click event on it. In the click we make an anonymous function and ignore the parameteres 
			(takes no argument). Inside, we want to use a module called "SILLY.DoIt". We pass in an object 
			in that module found by passing the #result id. To update this we result we create another button 
			called "clear" that clears the content of the #results. For that we handle the #clear click event,
			grab the #results and set the html of the #results to nothing which will clear out anything that's 
			in there. For that have to create the SILLY module in a new js file.
		-->
		<script>
			$('#silly').click(function() {
				SILLY.DoIt($('#results'));
			});
			$('#clear').click(function() {
				$('#results').html('');
			});
